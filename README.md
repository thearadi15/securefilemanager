Here’s a professional and comprehensive `README.md` for your **Secure File Manager** project:

---

# 🔐 Secure File Manager

**Secure File Manager** is a robust and user-friendly file management system designed with a strong focus on security and data privacy. It supports secure file operations such as **read**, **write**, **share**, and **view metadata**, while implementing advanced security features including **authentication**, **authorization**, **encryption**, and **threat detection**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔑 Authentication
- **Password-based login**  
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** for enhanced account security

### 🔒 Authorization & Access Control
- Role-based access system to restrict file operations
- File permissions for users and groups (read/write/share/view)

### 🛡️ Security Threat Detection
- **Buffer overflow protection**
- **Malware scanning** during file upload
- **Intrusion detection system (IDS)** flags suspicious behavior

### 🔐 Encryption
- **AES-256 encryption** for stored files
- **End-to-end encrypted file sharing**
- Encrypted metadata

### 📁 File Operations
- Upload, download, edit, delete files securely
- Share files securely with access tokens
- View encrypted file metadata
